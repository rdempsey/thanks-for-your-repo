## What is Thanks For Your Repo?

People want to thank you for the open source project you created. Thanks For Your Repo makes it easy for people to do so. By filling out the form below with your Github repo URL and Twitter handle, we'll give you a piece of code that you can add to your README file that displays a little "Say Thanks" button. When someone clicks on that button, it'll create a thank you tweet that they can send out.


## Basic Usage

Simply fill out the form at [http://rdempsey.github.io/thanks-for-your-repo/](http://rdempsey.github.io/thanks-for-your-repo/) and we'll generate the Say Thanks button code for you! Then, copy and paste the code from the alert box into the README file of your project.
